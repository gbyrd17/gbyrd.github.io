## About me:

I'm Graham, I'm a senior Physics undergraduate at the University of New Mexico.  This site was made on a whim while on a break back home in California.

The goal of this website is to be an outlet for me to display my interests academically.  I hope that with the more structured format of a website I will be more inclined to produce more structured work in my freetime, and present it in a manner fitting of a career scientist.

Currently my interests in physics lie in theoretical particle cosmology.  I am actively writing a thesis on the subject with the hopes of obtaining an honors designation upon completion of my degree.  My thesis explores the ramifications of neutrino oscillations in early universe perturbation theory.

Otherwise, I have a minor in Mathematics, where my interests lie in analytic functional analysis (real and complex), and computational methods.  I am interested in pure mathematics, and enjoy working through textbooks in my freetime.
