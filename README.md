## About me:

I'm Graham, I'm a senior Physics undergraduate at the University of New Mexico.  This site was made on a whim while on a break back home in California.

The goal of this website is to be an outlet for me to display my interests academically.  I hope that with the more structured format of a website I will be more inclined to produce more structured work, and present it in a manner fitting of a career scientist.
